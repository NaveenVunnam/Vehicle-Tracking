    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier\n",
    "* Optionally, you can also apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. \n",
    "* Note: for those first two steps don't forget to normalize your features and randomize a selection for training and testing.\n",
    "* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.\n",
    "* Run your pipeline on a video stream (start with the test_video.mp4 and later implement on full project_video.mp4) and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.\n",
    "* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.\n",
    "\n",
    " I started by reading(code cell [2]) in all the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` images.  Here is an example of one of each of the `vehicle` and `non-vehicle` classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image1]\n",
    "I have defined a function `color_hist()` to extract(code cell [3]) color histogram features. This function takes in color image and number of histogram bins and returns the concatenated color histogram features.\n",
    "Below figure visualizes the color histogram features of an RGB image. \n",
    "![alt text][image2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `bin_spatial()` takes in a image and a new image size(spatial_size) and returns a feature vector. The below figure visualizes the feature vectors after resizing the image.\n",
    "![alt text][image3]\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Extract HOG Features\n",
    "I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like. The code to extract HOG features is given in code cell [6] and [7]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:\n",
    "![alt text][image4]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried various combinations of HOG parameters, Spatial sizes and histogram bins. I settled on the final choice of parameters based upon the accuracy of the SVM classifier and the time it taken to extract and train the classifier. Below table shows the various combinations of parameters used and accuracy I got from SVM classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "First I tried using only spatially binned color and color histograms. Below table shows the various parameters used and the accuracy I got from SVM classifier.\n",

    "#### 1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?\n",
    "\n",
    "I have adapted the find_Cars() function(code cell [10]) from the Udacity lesson which can extract features and make predictions. It extracts hog features only once for each of the predetemined window sizes(defined bt scale argument). Each window is defined by a scaling factor that impacts the window size. The scale factor can be set on different regions of the image (small near the horizon, larger in the center. \n",
    "For our example are using a 64 x 64 base window. If we define pixels per cell as 8 x 8, then a scale of 1 would retain a window that's 8 x 8 cells (8 cells to cover 64 pixels in either direction). An overlap of each window can be defined in terms of the cell distance, using cells_per_step. This means that a cells_per_step = 2 would result in a search window overlap of 75% (2 is 25% of 8, so we move 25% each time, leaving 75% overlap with the previous window). Any value of scale that is larger or smaller than one will scale the base image accordingly, resulting in corresponding change in the number of cells per window. Its possible to run this same function multiple times for different scale values to generate multiple-scaled search windows. (This is taken from Udacity lesson Hog Sub-sampling Window search)\n",

I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  \n",

    "For this project I have spent a lot of time on selecting the best combination of HOG parameters. After selecting the best combination I have worked on selecting different scales and overlapping values for windows. There are lot of false positives detected on the left side of the car where shadows and different lighting conditions other than the ones from training set. This issue can be resolved by adding more dark images to the training data set. I would like try the same project using deep learning and will update you I got any better results.  \n",
